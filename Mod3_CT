#Creating Python Programs
#Part 1:
#Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The 
#program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food and then calculate the amounts 
#with an 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total 
#price.

charge_inputs = []  # Initialize an empty list

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter the charge for the food:\nType 'done' when no more prices to add. $")  # Get raw user input
    if user_input.lower() == 'done':  # Check if the user is done
        break
    try:
        charge = float(user_input)  # Convert to float only after confirming it's not 'done'
        charge_inputs.append(charge)  # Add the charge to the list
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number or 'done' to finish.")

print("Your list of inputs:", charge_inputs)

# Calculate tip and tax
tip = food_charge * 0.18
tax = food_charge * 0.07
total = food_charge + tip + tax

# Store all amounts in an array (list)
bill_components = [food_charge, tip, tax, total]

# Display the results
print(f"\nFood Charge: ${bill_components[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Tip (18%): ${bill_components[1]:.2f}")
print(f"Sales Tax (7%): ${bill_components[2]:.2f}")
print(f"Total Amount: ${bill_components[3]:.2f}")

#Part 2:
#Many people keep time using a 24-hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight). If it 
#is currently 13 and you set your alarm to go off in 50 hours, it will be 15 (3pm). Write a 
#Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time 
#now (in hours) and then ask for the number of hours to wait for the alarm. Your program 
#should output what the time will be on a 24-hour clock when the alarm goes off.
