#Creating Python Programs
#Part 1:
#Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The 
#program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food and then calculate the amounts 
#with an 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total 
#price.

o inputs = []  # Initialize an empty list

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a value (or type 'done' to finish): ")  # Get user input
    if user_input.lower() == 'done':  # Check if the user is done (case-insensitive)
        break  # Exit the loop
    inputs.append(user_input)  # Add the input to the list

print("Your list of inputs:", inputs)






#Part 2:
#Many people keep time using a 24-hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight). If it 
#is currently 13 and you set your alarm to go off in 50 hours, it will be 15 (3pm). Write a 
#Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time 
#now (in hours) and then ask for the number of hours to wait for the alarm. Your program 
#should output what the time will be on a 24-hour clock when the alarm goes off.
