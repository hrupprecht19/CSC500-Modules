#Creating Python Programs
#Part 1:
#Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.

#Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those 
#two numbers, add them together to find the output. Also, 
#subtract the two numbers to find the output.

num1 = int(input('Please provide a number.'))
num2 = int(input('Please provide another number.'))
print( num1, '+', num2 )
print(num1 - num2)




#Part 2:
#Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.

#Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two 
#numbers, multiply them #together to find the output. Also, divide 
#num1/num2 to find the output.

#Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the 
#application executing #the code from parts 1 and 2, the results and 
#GIT repository in a single document (Word is #preferred).
